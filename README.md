## Introduction

This project is created to learn react.js and next.js based on [this tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/).

The idea is to go through the tutorial and based on that build an application that is supposed to be a liter alternative for the Calibre ebook server.

Until decided differently, this repository's purpose is solely learning.
